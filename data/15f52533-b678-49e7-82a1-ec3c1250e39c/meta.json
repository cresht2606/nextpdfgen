For example, \"Today is Friday.\"\n4. **Truth Values**: Representations of the truth of a proposition using T (true) and F (false) or 1 and 0.\n\n(Page 5)\n\nNotes: The document does not provide examples of propositions directly related to Propositional Logic, but it mentions that some sentences can be checked as propositions and whether they are true or false."

      "text": "Propositions can be understood from both social and mathematical perspectives. \n\nIn a **social context**, according to the document on page 3, examples of propositions include sentences that are either true or false based on their content. For instance:\n- \"The discrete math is a required course to all IT students.\" This sentence could be considered a proposition because it can be evaluated as true or false depending on the institution's policy.\n- \"97 is a prime number.\" This is also a proposition, as its truth value (true) can be determined based on mathematical facts.\n- \"N is a prime number.\" This proposition\u2019s truth value depends on what N represents. If N is fixed to a specific number like 2, it would be true; otherwise, it could be false.\n\nIn a **mathematical context**, the document on page 7 introduces propositional logic and explains that propositions are statements that can be evaluated as either true or false. Propositions in this sense involve logical operators used to form new propositions from existing ones. The truth table for negation provided (Page 7) is an example of how a proposition's truth value changes based on the operator applied.\n\nTherefore, propositions are declarative sentences in both social and mathematical contexts that have a determinable state of being true or false."
